I investigated the relationship between amount of sea ice and amount of methane emitted in the arctic from 2002 to 2021. My hypothesis was that there is an inverse relationship between those two, which means that as amount of sea ice decreases, the emission of methane increases. I made a plot for each data, and a plot containing both data to see the trend, and as expected, the methane emission was inversely proportional to the amount of sea ice.
